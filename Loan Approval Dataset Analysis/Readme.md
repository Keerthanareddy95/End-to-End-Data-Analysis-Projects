### ðŸš€Project Stages

1. **Data Cleaning:** ðŸ«§
   - Processed and cleaned the dataset to ensure consistency and remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
   - Total Number of missing values found = 149
   - Visulaized the Null Values using Heat Maps ->
   - Heat map Before removing NULL values -

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** ðŸ“ˆ
   - Conducted thorough EDA to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships, and patterns within the cleaned data.
   - Visualized the features to get some key insights and identify patterns within the data ->
   - Bar Plot showing distribution of applicants based on their Location -
