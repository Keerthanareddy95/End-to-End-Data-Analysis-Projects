# Algerian-Forest-Fires-Dataset-Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, which includes data from two regions of Algeria: Bejaia (northeast) and Sidi Bel-abbes (northwest). The dataset spans the period from June 2012 to September 2012, comprising 244 instances, with 122 instances for each region.

### 📙About the Dataset

- **Attributes:** 11 features and 1 output attribute (class)
- **Class Distribution:** 138 instances classified as fire and 106 instances classified as not fire

### 🚀Project Stages

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Processed and cleaned the dataset to ensure consistency and remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted thorough EDA to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships, and patterns within the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engineered new features to enhance the model's predictive performance.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Utilized feature selection techniques to identify and keep the most relevant features for modeling.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Applied Linear Regression from the sklearn for predicting forest fires based on the selected features.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tuned model hyperparameters to optimize performance and achieve better results.
